# Idealized modeling of the Southern Ocean

This is an idealized reentrant channel model setup with full thermodynamics for studying Southern Ocean dynamics. The current model setup is forced with time-independent zonally uniform zonal wind stress, heat and freshwater fluxes. The meridional profiles are generated using smooth analytical functions and resemble real forcing data. Tracer profiles are relaxed to background profiles in a sponge region near the Northern boundary. Simple idealized topography is also present. The code for creating input files is available in a jupyter notebook.
