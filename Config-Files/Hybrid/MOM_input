/* This input file provides the adjustable run-time parameters for version 6 of the Modular Ocean Model (MOM6), a numerical ocean model developed at NOAA-GFDL. Where appropriate, parameters are given in MKS units.

This particular file is for the configuration "channel" and uses ALE scheme of MOM6 on z* grid.

This MOM_input file typically contains only the non-default values that are needed to reproduce this configuration.  A full list of parameters for this configuration can be found in the corresponding MOM_parameter_doc.all file which is generated by the model at run-time.
